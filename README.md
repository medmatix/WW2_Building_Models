# WW2_Building_Models
Blender model creations of Wartime Military Structures, Building and fixtures

In support of BCATP Airport Projects there is obviously a need for war time structures for historically accurate scenery on the bases. These modeling projects are kept here as they are worked on and once completed. The references below include a source (1) which reviews the development of the plans and ultimately the building requirements to be met. The facilities were never intended to be permanent but 70 years later many still stand, albeit in a wide range of upkeep  and disrepair.



### Wartime Hangars and Ground Support Structures

Hangars were designed and constructed in single, double and double-double configurations.
All bases had some form of gunnery backstop for re-sighting and aligning weapons. 

Work areas include the  hangers, sheds and garages, machine and carpentry shops and quonset huts.

### Barracks and Administration Structures

H-Huts were the mainstay of most facility building. 
Larger Barracks buildings are represented as two story cedar sided structures.
